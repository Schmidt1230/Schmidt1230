## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Stephan, I grew up in a tiny town in Limpopo, South Africa. I spent the first 19 years of my life here. I finished high school in 2019. Ever since I was little I was heavily invested in computers and when I discovered coding, it was a game changer. I had developed a dream to achieve a degree in Information Technology to learn more about my passion, however, the finances were not always available. Thus in 2020 and 2021, I went to work in the United States of America as a farm equipment operator. I had the absolute privilege to visit various great American states: Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota and North Dakota. I also had the opportunity to operate various machinery such as Tractors, Combine Harvesters, and Semi-Trucks. The greatest privilege of all was to be able to afford my studies after these two years. ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ :us:

I have one-month work experience in Semantic Web Development for the Nova Institute, the work comprised creating a Fluree Ledger (Graph Database Platform using JSON-LD) from the Docker Fluree Server Image and using Postman to send API calls to perform database operations on the Ledger. Also, I had to develop small Python tools which aided in PDF handling and converting.OWL/RDF Turtle files to JSON-LD.
